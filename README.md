You will need to create a virtual environment. First, install a `virtualenv`. It is an environment manager in Python.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

We create a virtual environment and call it `venv`.

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment on Windows, run the command below.

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
```

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the libraries you need to install to run the web application.
In your terminal, run the code below to install all the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the web application locally, run the code below:

```bash

```
